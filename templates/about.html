<h1>About This Project</h1>

<p>The College Food Choices Case Study is a research initiative examining how dietary decisions among college students relate to factors like GPA, exercise frequency, and income. By analyzing self-reported data and visualizing it with Tableau, we aim to identify opportunities for better nutrition education and healthier campus environments.</p>

<p>Our dashboards offer interactive insights into consumption patterns of fruits, vegetables, ethnic foods, comfort foods, and more. This project empowers educators, nutritionists, and administrators to make informed decisions that support student health and academic success.</p>
